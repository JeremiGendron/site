# JeremiGendron.com Source Code
Here you are able to find, look through and use the code which I wrote for jeremigendron.com

## Frontend
What you see when you visit the website

## Private
The dummy app I use to respond to user chats and set my status

## Redirects
Few pages uploaded to S3 which redirect to the frontend with a query string for
a vue-router hack

## Stream-server
The NodeJS apps I use to serve the live view on the website

## Lambda
Holds all of the JavaScript lambda functions I've written for all parts of the
website
